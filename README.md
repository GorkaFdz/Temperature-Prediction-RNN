# Temperature Prediction with Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository is for a project i did usint hourly temperature data in a time period of 5 years. The dataset is publicly available in [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data) from kaggle. My idea was to do some analysis on the data and then train a model to predict the tmperature based on the other variables.

After trying different aproaches to the LSTM Neural Network with the data as it was, what really improved the performance was adding a day of the year column. I also removed some temperature outliers (99 percentile) from the data because it reduced the errors. The model performs reasonably well and is able to predict the year 2017 pretty accurately. Looking at the residuals, they follow a normal distribution and do not present much heteroscedasticity. I tuned the architecture of the neural network to reduce overfitting and heteroscedasticity of the residuals. The model was overfitting and there was not homocedasticity in the residuals. At first I tried changing the parameters of the model and training size but the best solution was to add early stopping to the training process because this was what was affecting the performance.

Overall, this project helped me parctice with Neural Networks and expand my knowledge by looking up information and reading various articles.
